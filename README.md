Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and image processing, aimed at enhancing image quality by eliminating noise while preserving essential details. This project presents a Noise Removal Tool that integrates multiple denoising techniques to improve image clarity. The tool implements traditional filtering methods (mean, median, Gaussian, and bilateral filters), frequency-domain filtering (Fourier and wavelet transforms), and deep-learning-based approaches (autoencoders and convolutional neural networks).
The system allows users to select a denoising method based on the noise type and intensity. Comparative analysis is performed to evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques in reducing Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, and speckle noise in various images. The tool is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable for applications in medical imaging, photography, and computer vision. Experimental results demonstrate that deep-learning-based denoising methods outperform conventional filtering techniques in preserving fine details while effectively removing noise.
This project contributes to the field of image processing by providing a versatile and efficient noise removal solution, aiding in tasks such as image enhancement, feature extraction, and automated image analysis.
